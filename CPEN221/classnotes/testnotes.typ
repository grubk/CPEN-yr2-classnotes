= Preconditions

When does a method need a precondition or a postcondition?
A method with no explicit parameters *may* need a precondition. ie:
```java
void findProtein() {
    return isProtein;
}
```

This method has no explicit parameters, but needs a parameter if the DNA type is not checked to be valid or not.
