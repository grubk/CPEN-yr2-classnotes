= Tutorial 7 - "The Complete Computer Engineer"
== Four questions will be answered
- What should every student know to get a good job?
- What should every student know to maintain lifelong employment?
- What should every student know to enter graduate school?
- What should every student know to benefit society?

== Portfolio versus Resume
- Every student should build a portfolio
- Resume says nothing of a programmer's ability

== Presentation
- Master presentation tools such as PowerPoint, Keynote
- Takeaways from other presentations:
  - Learn key points (1 or 2)
  - What was good about presentation
  - What can I learn about presentations 

== Engineering Core
- Linear algebra (most important)
- Calculus
- Probability
- Physics (up to some electromagnetism)

== The Unix Philosophy
- Become comfortable with command-line computing, text-file configuration, IDE-less software development
  - Navigate/manipulate filesystem
  - Compose processes with pipes
  - Edit files with vim/emacs 
  - Create, modify, execute Makefile for a software project
  - Write simple shell scripts

=== Some command-line challenges
- find five folders in a directory consuming the most space
- report duplicate MP3s (by file conttents, not name)
- take list of names whose first and last names have been lowercased, and uppercase them 


=== Some linux/unix challenges
- Install linux distro
- Configure and comiple linux kernel
- Troubleshoot a connection with dig, ping and traceroute
- Compile and configure a web server like apache
- (others on slides)

- symmetric-key cryptosystems
- public-key cryptosystems
- secure hash functions
- challengeresponse authentication
- digital signature algorithms
- threshold cryptosystems
- RSA algorithm
- Recommended: Cryptography Engineering, Ferguson

== UI/UX Design
- Recommended: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information - Tufte

== Parallelism
- Software that runs on multiple CPUS, etc.
- CUDA, OpenCL

== Software Engineering
- git, CI/CD

== Utilize Professors
- Ask about a professor's research
- Go to office hours
- Sit in front row 
- Take difficult courses that 'good' profs teach
- Don't be afraid to drop courses if ur giga fucked
